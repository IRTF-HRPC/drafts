# Introduction

The aim of this document is to use a feminist framework to analyse the impacts of internet protocols on society. It assumes that values are inherent to technological design and specifies how those values can either support or create barriers for gender justice and equity for internet users. The Gender at Work framework provides a four-quadrant analysis along the axes of individual-systemic and informal-formal. This feminist discussion of internet protocols focusses in the various quadrants. Additionally 
 * Feminism challenges power
 * Intersectional feminism
 * Five layers of power

## Embodied (anonymity)

As a starting point, recognize the digital gap. Who uses and who develops the Internet as we know it today? With the popularization of the internet around the world, it is neccesary to recognize that some of the terms that have been used in the IETF context have alternative meanings in the wide range social context. Is it enough to talk about ‘security’ as a technical issue only? Or adversary?

Most of the threats women and non binary people face on line, occur in the user level, as they mostly use what apps offer, without exploring other possibilities on the network. Their adversaries are mostly other users who use the platform advanced -or not advanced- possibilities for threatening their expressions.

While anonymity is never just about technical issues but users protection activities, it becomes more necessary to strenghten the design and functionality of networks, by default.
