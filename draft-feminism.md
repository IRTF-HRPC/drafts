# Introduction

** This document aims to describe how internet standrds and protocols and its implementatios have different effects on diverse groups and communities use. As well as some protocol can be enabler for a especific human right while possibly restricting another [rfc8280], any human rights enbler protocol may imply greater vulnerabilities for specific groups.

** What is the need inside the IETF? To recognize that every discourse, practice, decision with regard to internet infraestructure, standards and protocols, directly or indirectly may affect internet users rights around the world.

** Why feminism and not gender? Because of the existance of Feminist Principles of the Internet [gender and sexual rights lens on critical internet-related rights // framework for women's movements to articulate and explore issues related to technology], which are built in a bottom up way by the feminist movement.

** Why feminism and not diversity? 

The aim of this document is to use a feminist framework to analyse the impacts of internet protocols on society. It assumes that values are inherent to technological design and specifies how those values can either support or create barriers for gender justice and equity for internet users. The Gender at Work framework provides a four-quadrant analysis along the axes of individual-systemic and informal-formal. This feminist discussion of internet protocols focusses in the various quadrants. Additionally 
 * Feminism challenges power
 * Intersectional feminism
 * Five layers of power
 
 ** How does intersectional feminism refer to diversity?
 
## Expression as a framework of understanding

Some documents have shown how the behaviour and languaje conventions within the IETF can favour or negatively affect the use of the Internet: 
* [rfc7704] poses some questions about limitations of diversity in many engineering environments like IETF, and the hostile behaviour which is both a product and produces such limitations.  
* Draft on Terminology, Power and Oppressive Language [Knodel and ten Oever] points out the possibe effects of terminology used in RFCs, that has been identified as oppressive, racist and sexist, given the importance of communication at the IETF, and soggests alternative terminology.

With de popularizarion of internet, it has been clear that the designing of protocols has political inplications on diverse social groups around the world. For vulnerable and marginalized groups, Internet has been an enabler or mani values like protest, amplifying of voices, freedom of expresión, both verbal and physical an aesthetic, but its design imply some vulnerabilities for marginalized groups like women, people of color and indigenous people, sexual and gender diversities.

* Social, cultural, economic and political disparities.

The discursive level in IETF documents. The unexpected influence of discourse in technical documents over internet users through implementations. 
Gendered presence in drafts and RFCs (from entities to men and women) stereotyped roles
Diversity (language, access, producers-users)



"Legal restrictions were extended to the internet realm arbitrarily and involved lawsuits or arrests based on things like Facebook comments, registering domain names and blog posts." (erotics)

"LGBT activists began their work online in chat rooms, websites and mailing lists by force because of their limited access to public spheres dominated by homophobia that could lead to socialstigma and/or imprisonment" (erotics)

"With the rise in the power of user-generated online content, the blogosphere and citizen journalism, queer women chose to create their own e-media channels rather than rely on traditional journalism to address queer issues." (erotics)

## Access
Internet access is recognized as a human right [UNITED NATIONS], but its effective guarantee depends on different and unequal social, cultural, economic and political conditions. In 2018, barely half of the world's population has access to the internet and in 88% of countries, men have more access than women [ITU Statistics]. Geographical location, age, educational and income level, as well as gender, significantly determine how people access to the Internet [webFoundation].

The [Feminist Principles of the Internet] enphasizes that access must be to a universal, acceptable, affordable, unconditional, open, meaningful and equal Internet, which guarantees rights rather than restricts them. As some bodies have always been subject to social and cultural surveillance and violence because of their gender and sexuallity, their access to Internet is not satisfied with connected devices, but with safety digital enviroments [Jac Sm Kee].

In this sense, access must be considered in several dimensions, in addition to Internet access as a possibility of being connected:

### Access to information  
Information in one's own language is the first condition, as pointed out with the cencept of 'Localization' [rfc8280], referred to the act of tailoring an application for a different language, script, or culture, and involves not only changing the language interaction but also other relevant changes, such as display of numbers, dates, currency, and so on.

But it is also necessary to be able to access relevant information, related for example to sexual and reproductive health and rights, pleasure, safe abortion, access to justice, and LGBTIQ issues. Some goverments and block pages with this content or monitor online activity by sexual and gender related terminology.

### Usage of technology
Beyond content, access reclaim the possibility to use, which means code, design, adapt and critically and sustainably use ICTs. As almost 75% of connected individuals are placed in the Global South [Sengupta and Bouterse], technology is developped mainly in rich countries [reference] where student quotas and jobs are filled mainly by men [reference]. 

The concept of 'Internationalization' [rfc6365] refers to the practice of making protocols, standards, and implementations usable in different languages. This is a first step to democratize the development of technology, allowing its implementation in non-English-speaking countries.

However, there is still a long way to go in terms of inclusion of more diverse populations in the spaces of technology development and definition of protocoles and standards for the Internet infrastructure [rfc7704].  The presence of gendered agents in the IETF's archive demonstrates stereotyped male and feminine roles. On the other hand, the generalized mention of agents - as universal subjects - in those documents, ignores the existence of other corporealities, which includes non binary identities or with a marked physical difference [reference]. 
 * Challenge the cultures of sexism and discrimination in all spaces.

##### Tech terms

 * Accesibility [rfc4084] Related to people with disabilities
 * Connectivity [rfc1958]
 * Reliability (not sure)

### Free and open source
The digital gender gap has relegated women and other marginalized groups to be internet users, adding content but usually not knowing how the platforms they access work. Promoting transparency [rfc 8280] and simplifying technical terminology is necessary to bridge the gap.
 * Terms upon which we create technology
 * Terms upon which we experimenting with others' technology
 * Promoting, disseminating, and sharing knowledge about technology.
 
#### Tech terms
 * Open standards [rfc2026]

### Internet governance
While there is no agreement regarding the ability of the Internet to negatively or positively impact on social behaviors, or shape desirable practices [rfc8280], while more women and diverse population participate in technical development spaces, as well as decision-making spaces, there will be greater possibilities for ICTs to reflect greater inclusiveness and enable less risky and harmful interactions [rfc7704].

 * Challenge processes and institutions that govern the internet
 * Put more feminists and queers at the decision-making table
 * Democratise policy making affecting the internet
 * Diffuse ownership of and power in global and local networks


## Economic

 * Challenges capitalism
 * Alternative models
 * Cooperation
 * Solidarity
 * Commons
 * Environmental sustainability
 * Openness.
 
#### Tech terms

 * Content agnosticism. Treating network traffic identicaly regardless of content. (Not sure. It may be in expression or incorporated, but I want it to remain here thinking about technopolitics, creating for example a webpage or an app which is blocked or nos easyly accessed because of traffic controls).
 * Descentralized. Implementation or deployment of standards, protocols or systems without one single point of control.
 * Federation. Connecting without a central authority.

## Embodied (anonymity)

As a starting point, recognize the digital gap. Who uses and who develops the Internet as we know it today? With the popularization of the internet around the world, it is neccesary to recognize that some of the terms that have been used in the IETF context have alternative meanings in the wide range social context. Is it enough to talk about ‘security’ as a technical issue only? Or adversary?

Most of the threats women and non binary people face on line, occur in the user level, as they mostly use what apps offer, without exploring other possibilities on the network. Their adversaries are mostly other users who use the platform advanced -or not advanced- possibilities for threatening their expressions.

While anonymity is never just about technical issues but users protection activities, it becomes more necessary to strenghten the design and functionality of networks, by default.
