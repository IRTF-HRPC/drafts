# Introduction

The aim of this document is to use a feminist framework to analyse the impacts of internet protocols on society. It assumes that values are inherent to technological design and specifies how those values can either support or create barriers for gender justice and equity for internet users. The Gender at Work framework provides a four-quadrant analysis along the axes of individual-systemic and informal-formal. This feminist discussion of internet protocols focusses in the various quadrants: individual-informal, individual-formal, systemic-informal, systemic-formal [revisit: include examples of each quadrant wrt protocols]. By framework, we mean to include not simply feminist ideology, but also feminist voices, practice and movements as both examples and guidance.

At its core, feminism challenges power dynamics. This document follows the classification of power by digital women's rights activist Jac sm Kee and is divided into sections that outline five layers of power: structural, discursive, economic, embodied and networked.

Feminism as an ideology, like many ideologies, lacks a uniform definition. As a framework that exists to challenge power, the ideology that best achieves this is one of intersectional feminism, or simply, intersectionality. Intersectionality is a flavour of feminism that recognises the structures that exert power over people because of their gender are the same structures that exert power over people for other reasons, such as race, class, sexuality, religion, age and ability. Intersectionality recognises the complex identities of people, who may identify as more than one target, and, more importantly, that power operates best when it creates stratification and hierarchy among targets. Intersectional feminism, susequently referred to as "feminisim" in this document, is the basis for the analysis presented in the document.
